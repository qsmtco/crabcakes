# tests/test_feed_snapshot_off_thread.py
# SPEC-UI-RESPONSIVENESS-2 §2.5 Phase 5 — git/snapshot work off the main thread.
#
# Edits under test:
#   A. on_filesystem_event() no longer calls snapshot_from_git_diff() inline;
#      the card is created with conversation_snapshot=None.
#   B. the pure snapshot construction runs on the "crabcakes-snapshot-builder"
#      thread; only the widget update is dispatched back via GLib.idle_add.
#      (The GTK-bound chat-box walk stays on the main thread.)
#   C. multiple filesystem events for the same (project_path, file_path) on
#      one tick build the diff ONCE.
#
# GLib double: dispatches are RECORDED and run only when the test flushes them
# (the handler's own contract says idle_add defers to the next main-loop cycle,
# so running them inline would fire _finalize_snapshot before add_card has
# stored the card). _pump() alternates flushing + polling so a dispatch
# produced by the background worker is picked up too.
#
# Hermeticity: every project path is a tmp_path; the pure git call is patched
# (no real git subprocess) and the real conversation store is never touched.
