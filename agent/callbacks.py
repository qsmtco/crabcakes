"""Typed callback protocols for AgentRuntime → UI handler.

The runtime accepts 9 callbacks in its constructor and dispatches them via
its private ``_dispatch()`` helper (see ``agent/runtime.py``). This module
formalizes the contract: the protocol signatures here are the source of
truth, and the handler's ``_on_*`` methods (in
``ui/handlers/agent_runtime_handler.py``) must match them structurally.

Architecturally: ``agent/callbacks.py`` is the boundary between the
runtime's orchestration logic and the UI's render pipeline. Both sides
reference the protocols; neither imports from the other. This is the same
pattern as ``agent/llm/protocol.py`` (the ``LLMProvider`` Protocol that
all provider classes implement).

Layer rules: this module imports only from ``typing``. It MUST NOT import
from ``agent.runtime``, ``ui/``, ``gateway/``, or ``models/`` (per
``docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`` §8.6). It also MUST NOT use
``@runtime_checkable`` — we don't need ``isinstance()`` checks at
runtime; the protocols are documentation, not enforcement.

Keyword contract: every ``__call__`` signature accepts a keyword-only
``_turn_token: object | None = None`` (note the leading underscore). The
runtime's ``_dispatch`` helper at ``agent/runtime.py:420`` passes
callbacks with ``_turn_token=token`` (see production dispatch sites at
``agent/runtime.py:673, 892, 902, 913, 934, 940, 1169, 1257, 1265,
1421, 1434, 1705, 1884``). The leading underscore signals "internal use
only; receivers may ignore it" without making it positional. A previous
draft of this module used ``turn_token`` (no underscore) which broke
``create_autospec`` validation against the real callback signatures —
this is the exact contract drift that BUG #7 in
SPEC-RUNTIME-TERMINAL-PATH-CONSOLIDATION §2.1 was created to prevent.
